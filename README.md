# Ubisoft NEXT 2024-2025 Programming Challenge

Hi!  This is my submission for Ubisoft's annual NEXT Programming Challenge.

The theme this year was Minigolf and I decided to make a top-down minigolf game featuring 3 levels, various obstacles to avoid, and a simplistic control scheme

Although my submission did not advance to future stages, I'm still proud of what I managed to accomplish during the challenge weekend.  As someone who was taught mostly in C# and Unity, coming back to C++ (especially since we couldn't use OpenGL code, the other tool I was taught in school) was a bit of a challenge but I quickly got my footing and delivered on my personal goals for the project.

## Controls

As previously mentioned, the control scheme is simplistic to ensure that anyone is able to pick up and play the game.

Players use their mouse to aim  their shot (as indicated by the line connecting the ball and the mouse

F to adjust the power of the shot

Space to hit the ball
